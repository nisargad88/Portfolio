        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <hr>
        <li>DevSkill HUB | FrontEnd Web Development Intern |Virtual</li>
        <p>I  completed a one-month front-end development internship where I worked on designing and developing web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During this time, I learned how to create responsive designs and implement basic user interface features, gaining hands-on experience in essential front-end technologies.</p>
        <li>Built responsive websites using HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li> Added interactivity to web pages with basic JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Worked on improving website layout and design.</li>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Automatic Street Light System:</h3><p>Developed an innovative automatic street light system using Arduino, LDR (LightDependent Resistor), and IR sensors to enhance energy efficiency and public safety. The system utilizes an LDR to detect ambient light levels, automatically switching the lights on at dusk and off at dawn</p>
        <h3>Bluetooth Controlled Robotic Car —Using Arduino microcontroller, IOT device:</h3><p>The Bluetooth Controlled Robotic Car uses an Arduino microcontroller and an IoT device to enable wireless control via a smartphone. It communicates through Bluetooth, allowing real-time control of the car's movements. The system integrates motors, sensors, and a Bluetooth module, offering an interactive robotics experience. Ideal for learning embedded systems and IoT.</p>
        <h3>Solar Based mobile Charger:</h3><p>The Solar-Based Mobile Charger harnesses solar energy to charge mobile devices, providing an eco-friendly and portable power solution. It utilizes photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, stored in a battery for later use. This charger is ideal for off-grid or emergency situations, promoting renewable energy use for everyday needs.</p>
        <h3>Clap Switch Using Relay:</h3><p>The Clap Switch using a relay is a sound-activated device that toggles electrical appliances on and off with a clap. A microphone captures the sound, which is processed by a circuit to trigger the relay, controlling the connected device. This project demonstrates the integration of sound sensors and relays for automation.</p>
        <h2>Activities</h2><hr>
        <ul>  
            <li>Completed short term course in ‘ COMPUTER HARDWARE FUNDAMENTALS’ in Feb-2023 conducted by National skill development corporation.</li>
            <li>Attended ’CLOUD COMPUTING’ Workshop in Sep-2023 conducted by MES college Bangalore.</li>
            <li>Attended ONE DAY ROBOTICS workshop conducted by MES college in December 2022.</li>
